### WoW TTS
Real time text-to-speech for World of Warcraft quests using LibSerpix!
## Download
## First time setup
1. Ensure your UI scale is set to 100% at all times. Windowed and fullscreen are both supported
2. Ensure no color-altering features are being used
3. Copy the QuestTextSender addon into your addons folder
## Usage
Open WoW and turn on the QuestTextSender addon. Run WoWTTS.exe. Text-to-speech is performed on the following events:

1. Reading quest text
2. Reading quest progress text
3. Reading quest completion text
4. Interacting with an NPC
## Limitations
This program is a kooky experiment that transmits data-containing pixels on the screen. It's not perfect and may not work everywhere. Please remember the following:

1. Anything that impacts the size or color of the drawn pixels will drop communication
2. The screen reader is capable of missing messages. Try clicking on an NPC again if you think your message wasn't played
